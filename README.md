# Software Testing 
>Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets specified requirements and functions correctly. It involves executing the software under controlled conditions to identify any defects, errors, or gaps in the desired functionality. 

### Importance of Software Testing:
1. Quality Assurance:
    
```   
Ensures the software meets the expected standards and performs as intended.
```
2. Identifying Defects Early:
```
      Detects bugs and issues early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them later.
  ```

3. User Satisfaction:
```
Ensures the software is reliable and performs well, leading to higher user satisfaction.
```
4. Security:
```
Identifies vulnerabilities that could be exploited, ensuring the software is secure.
```
5. Compliance:
```

Ensures the software complies with relevant regulations and standards.
```
6. Performance:
```
Verifies that the software performs well under various conditions, including high load scenarios.
```
7. Compatibility:
```
Ensures the software works across different environments, devices, and platforms.
```

8. Business Continuity:
```
Prevents failures that could disrupt business operations and lead to financial loss.
```
9. Reputation:
```
A well-tested software product enhances the reputation of the company, building trust with customers and stakeholders.
```

#### Unit Testing : 
```
* Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of the software are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. 
* It is mostly done by Developers sometime QA.
```
#### Integration testing:
```
Integration testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this testing is to identify issues in the interactions between integrated units.

Type of Integratin Testing / System testing
- Big Bang Approach
- Incremental : a)Top Down approch b) Bottom Up approach


```
#### E2E Testing / UI testing:
```
End-to-End (E2E) testing is a type of software testing that validates the entire software system flow from start to finish. The purpose is to simulate real user scenarios and ensure the system works as expected across all integrated components, including databases, network infrastructure, and other external interfaces.

## SYSTEM TESTING:
* Testing over all functionality of the application with respective client requirements.
* It is a black box testing technique.
* This testing is conducted by testing team.
* After completion of component and integration level testing's we start System testing.
* Before conducting system testing we should know the customer requirements


**System Testing focus on:**
- [ ] User Interface Testing (GUI)
- [ ] Functional Testing
- [ ] Non-Functional Testing
- [ ] Usability Testing 


**System Testing Process: System Testing is performed in the following steps:**

* Test Environment Setup: Create testing environment for the better quality testing.
* Create Test Case: Generate test case for the testing process.
* Create Test Data: Generate the data that is to be tested.
* Execute Test Case: After the generation of the test case and the test data, test cases are executed.
* Defect Reporting: Defects in the system are detected.
* Regression Testing: It is carried out to test the side effects of the testing process.
* Log Defects: Defects are fixed in this step.
* Retest: If the test is not successful then again test is performed.
